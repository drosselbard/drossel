Basically just did this on a whim ^^'
It just trains a random forest on some data and tries to predict possible future characteristics of an upcoming super mario mainline game.

The code is written in R and uses RStudio to use the package 'rstudioapi'.

If there are any questions hit me up on discord --> drosselbard

Have fun :)

PS: This will probably never get updated
